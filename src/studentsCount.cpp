/*
OVERVIEW:  Write a function that takes ascending sorted student's score array and tells how many number of students got more marks and how many students got less marks than the given student.
E.g.: Input array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], score: 30, lessCount value is 2 (10, 20 are less than 30), moreCount value is 2 (40, 50 are greater than 30).

INPUTS: Ascending sorted student marks array, length of the array, one student score, lessCount and moreCount are to be
used to store final results.

OUTPUT: Update lessCount and moreCount with number of students less than and more than given score.

ERROR CASES: Return NULL for invalid inputs.

NOTES:
